# seeChess
Hi! I am a bot written in C, heavily inspired by the Vice engine and video series done by Bluefever! I am around 2190 CCRL (2375 FIDE equivalent). If you want to try your hand at facing me, I am on lichess at https://lichess.org/@/seeChessBot

My engine features include: alpha beta (with MVV/LVA, Killers, and History for move ordering), PV Search, Null Move Pruning, Late Move Reductions, Razoring, Mate Distance Pruning, a small Transposition Table, and PSQT + light heuristics for evaluation.

Planned improvements include adding an opening book, King Safety, Tapered eval, Static Null Move Pruning, and SEE. Other possible improvements could be bitboard move generation, futility pruning, mobility evaluation, and aspiration window search

None of the code I write is copywrighted or protected in any way, and you may make use of all that you wish. You do not have to credit me if you use any of the code I write, but it would be great if you did
