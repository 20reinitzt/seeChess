# seeChess
Hi! I am a bot written in C, heavily inspired by the Vice engine and video series done by Bluefever! I am on lichess as seeChessBot, and have a lichess bullet rating of 2050.

My engine features include: alpha beta (with MVV/LVA, Killers, and History for move ordering), PV Search, Null Move Pruning, Late Move Reductions, Razoring, Mate Distance Pruning, a small Transposition Table, and piece square tables for evaluation.

Planned improvements include adding an opening book, King Safety, Tapered eval, Static Null Move Pruning, and SEE. Other possible improvements could be bitboard move generation, futility pruning, mobility evaluation, and aspiration window search
